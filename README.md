# DeathStar2

This project prototypes an IndexedDB database for a room tracking system for the new Death Star.

In space, wifi is spotty at best. Typically when the HyperDrive is engaged, the wifi drops out completely. To combat this, Darth Vader has put in a project request for an offline implementation of the access system. The access system determines which Storm Troopers have access to certain parts of the Death Star 2. 

*(Note: it's really best if you don't ask _why_ it's call Death Star 2, or what happened to the first Death Star)*

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
